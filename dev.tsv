718	719	Persuasive	Another stupid Authoritarian about to make another stupid mistake.
253	254	Informational	The Counsellors of State are composed of the spouse of the monarch plus the first four people in line for the throne who are over 21 years of age and they are basically authorized to stand in for the monarch under various circumstances. With the queen's death, Beatrice just joined that group; she'll be replaced by George when he's old enough and then Charlotte will knock Andrew out when she's old enough; Harry will be replaced by Louis.  It may be that Charles is looking to modify who can be Counsellor of State such as adding a restriction of working royals to that but I don't know if there'd be four such unless you start including spouses who technically aren't in line for the throne. (Harry, Andrew, and Beatrice are not working royals whereas Kate and Anne are.) Charles also wants fewer working royals so, again, not quite sure what's the eventual plan there.  Now, I'm not sure how all this intersects b/c as I understand it, let's take Andrew as an example. He's a member of the Counsellors of State because he's in line for the throne. But he's not a working royal (look for that blue sash) since his mother stripped him of all duties and public representation. And I've already mentioned working royals who are not close enough in line of succession to be in the Counsellors (or not in succession at all) but absolutely represent the monarch at various events.  As for the queen's approval, it's been known for a number of years that Charles intends to streamline the number of working royals, so she certainly was aware of his plans. (And of course at this point, her approval or not is completely moot.)

912	913	Informational	"The comments under the article about M√©xico's ""peace plan"" make me roll my eyes so hard. As a latina, I must say most reddit users don't represent the community, they tend to be *much* more conservative and upper class.  The reason why AMLO did this is mostly... Because he wanted to be seen doing ""something"" without actually doing anything. This is 100% Latam go-to maneuver. Condemn violence and war, but try to not take any concrete action; say how you wish this violence/war would end soon (yes, even if it's an invasion and it's dumb to propose this). It's just how politicians here roll, and AMLO isn't a very competent president, so you can expect even less from him."

516	517	Humorous	Uh..I need money
584	585	Persuasive	Does the plan start with Russia leaving Ukranian land including Crimea, returning all the stolen kids and paying for the damage as well as compensation for all the civilians they've killed?  Then it's a waste of paper.
86	87	Persuasive	The US cannot take the bait. Don't let this be the Zimmermann Telegram all over again. We can't let ourselves be drawn into a war on false pretenses again.

Instead, Russia has relied largely on contract soldiers recruited from remote and impoverished regions.   &gt;   &gt;...

24	25	Support/Disapproval	Day 207, 204 more days than expected by most, it'll be a bittersweet day when these updates are no longer posted because Russia has been completely kicked out of Ukraine.
642	643	Inquiry	Ending as the lives of all Ukrainians?
735	736	Informational	"Putin probably sent them something similar to the Zimmerman telegram al la WW1. Probably read something like this: ""If you convince the Ukrainians to let us regroup, we will let you have America when we defeat all of NATO."" Mexicans are still salty about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. They love to remind Americans that Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Utah, Nevada, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma are theirs, and we stole the land from them. President Polk should have just let General Scott take the whole damn thing. Would have been better for almost everyone in the end."

799	800	Informational	Mexican here. I obviously can't confirm this, but it sounds 10000000000% feasible and possible. Specially with the current government. Let me explain why.  Basically from my experience, there is A FUCKING TON of hate towards the US and the West in general. Like, A LOT of deep rooted hatred towards the US.  There is a lot of people who still genuinely feel deep rage and anger over the US annexation of former Mexican territory or the Spanish conquest of native indigenous civilizations (even if modern Mexicans treat native indigenous peoples horribly themselves).  Therefore A LOT of people will support LITERALLY anything that goes against American and Western interests.  It doesn't matter if it's Hitler or the devil himself, actually, it doesn't even matter if it goes directly against Mexican interests either, as long as it goes against the US and the ‚Äúevil‚Äù West, A TON of people will blindly support it.
965	966	Persuasive	Turkey is attempting to enrage everyone at once.
313	314	Support/Disapproval	He shouldn't be in a position to tell anybody anything.
745	746	Humorous	I also like shiny things. I use glitter in my varnish and paints. Don't let the sadness of diamonds put you off precious gemstones, shiny pretty stones are a good thing.  I lecture hypocritically from a lithium battery phone powered by artisan lithium mining. when I say Artisan I mean impoverished or child labour.  I would take the diamond mine over the lithium mine every day of the week, lithium is foul.
