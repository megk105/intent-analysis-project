599	600	Informational	 TAIPEI (Taiwan News) ‚Äî The deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) says Chinese leader Xi Jinping (ÁøíËøëÂπ≥) wants the military to be ready to invade Taiwan in 2027, though he will not necessarily order the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to do so, reports said Saturday (Sept. 17).  CNN intelligence and national security correspondent Katie Bo Lillis tweeted that CIA Deputy Director David Cohen had told her Xi wants ‚Äúto have the capability to take control of Taiwan by force by 2027.‚Äù However, he added that the United States intelligence community did not believe Xi had already reached a decision about when to launch an invasion.  Xi ‚Äúhas asked his military to put him in a position where, if that's what he wanted to do, he would be able to,‚Äù Lillis quoted Cohen as saying. The CIA official said the Chinese leader still preferred to ‚Äúget control through nonmilitary means,‚Äù the CNN correspondent tweeted.  American Military News reported that U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley last year attributed the date of 2027 to a speech by Xi. The Communist leader told the PLA to ramp up its modernization in order to be able to seize Taiwan in 2027 instead of in 2035, Milley told Congress.  The top U.S. general also emphasized that Xi wanted the capability, but had not reached a decision to launch an attack.

The response of Calder√≥n was to use our army to ""hunt"" the opposing cartels in the streets and the only thing that achieved while trying to protect his interests, was to unleash a bloodbath that is still echoing to this day and that took the life of thousands of civilians.   * The current president stopped Calderon's and Pe√±a Nieto's usage of the arme and is going to force them act under a set of orders and plans that before, were completely secret and obviously absent since the army was more like another Cartel group which had absolute power to start a shooting in the middle of a market just because ""someone"" gave them the instruction to do so. A lot of people are using this to twist the reality and claiming that the president is militarizing the country which is incredibly idiotic and completely false.   * So in short, for right winged Mexicans: Having the army act freely, make shootings anywhere, and having news of soldiers actually being undercover sicarios = good. Having the army follow rules = AMLO wants Mexico to be like Venezuela.   * Mexico's external relations have ALWAYS been of neutrality. Mexico's UN embassy and the President explicitly condemned Putin, but they said they weren't going to join Biden's sanctions, which let me remind you, have achieved **ABSOLUTELY NOTHING** but backfiring on the U.S. and Europe's civilians.   * When the invasion happened and Mexico decided not to join in with the sanctions, the opposing party from the current president, the ultra conservative PAN, tried to make a ""Mexico's Russian Appreciation Agency"" or something like that, in an idiotic attempt of making it seem like it was an official government thing. Of course, it made it to Reddit and some people ate it straight. It seems like Mr. Zeleneskyy is desperately looking to get the attention of the U.S. now trying to throw their neighbors under the bus."

I wouldn't want to trade with the Russian Federation, and I wouldn't like anyone to trade and get Russian ammonia, I'll tell you frankly... I will be really frank with you - I said that I would be against ammonia supplies from the Russian Federation via Ukraine. I'm willing to go for it only if we exchange the supply of ammonia for our prisoners. I proposed this to the UN,"" the president said.*        *Answering the question of what steps he would like to be taken by the participants in the UN General Assembly session regarding the war with the Russian Federation, Zelensky opined that certain discussions among the leaders would continue there, that certain documents would be adopted, and that ""the prime minister, the minister of foreign affairs... they know their job.""*        *Read also: Zelensky on torture, airstrikes in Izium: ‚ÄúI don't know how many thousands died there‚Äù*    *""I think it is important to raise two points as high as possible on the agenda among the leaders and achieve a result. The first is still to find the right mechanism, and to support the resolution regarding it, for asset return, refunds from the occupiers, etc. We really need this mechanism but it doesn't exist yet,"" Zelensky said.*        *Another step he called the resolution on the creation of a special tribunal for war crimes and those who committed these crimes.*        *""Separately in the USA, it is necessary, probably at the level of the UN platform, to also discuss the issue of recognizing the Russian Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism. This is also a very important step,"" he said.*        *Among other important issues relevant to Ukraine, the president mentioned the budget deficit, the significant need to resolve certain issues with the IMF, and the need to agree on a new cooperation program. According to Zelensky, ""we have started this work.""*        *""The USA and the UN are a good platform to this end as well. So there are many things to focus on,"" he clarified.*        *As reported, reports emerged in the Western media claiming that the UN is putting pressure on Ukraine and the Russian Federation in order to restore the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa pipeline for further export of ammonia via the Black Sea as part of the ""grain initiative.""*        *For his part, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Ukraine will learn the details of the UN initiative to restore the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline and that it will make no decision that would be against the country's interests.*"

572	573	Informational	"Russia pulling back its anti-air missile defences from the Finnish border. Which means one of the following or all of them:  1. Russia is running out of missiles and needs to scrap together more from anywhere, like using SSM capable AA missile systems. Russia has already been using anti-ship missiles against land targets, and the S-300 in the ground attack role.  2. Russia has lost so much of its AA capability in Ukraine that it needs to bring in more even from high-priority areas, increasingly cannibalizing its priority defence capability to keep fighting in Ukraine.  3. Russia simply needs more AA capability yet for some reason didn't bother to bring these in for the invasion or any time earlier during the invasion.   I think #1 is the most likely explanation. They have limited stockpiles, they have limited capability to make more especially now with sanctions, they have used a lot of them on pointless terrorism, Ukraine has been getting better at shooting them down, and even when they are used against valid targets, the keyword in Russian missile is ""miss"". Russia will always keep a few advanced missiles in the reserve if they have any sense left, so I doubt Russia will literally run out, but they certainly can't afford to keep up a constant missile bombardment.   Also, Russia being willing to take away missile defences from so close to the border in one of their top priority areas shows yet again that all their claims of the threat of NATO are nonsense."

Sure, we might have the odd housing bubble or stock market correction, but look at the BRICS countries and tell me which you think is stable and a good choice as a reserve country.  Brazil? Check out /r/offdutybraziliancop and tell me that seems reasonable.  Russia? It's going to be lucky if it doesn't collapse and fragment after losing in Ukraine.  India? India's got potential for being part of a reserve basket of currencies. Give it a couple of years.  China? Let's see if it avoids a full on real estate meltdown first.  South Africa? Please. Let's see if they can get the corruption marginally under control first.  Nobody's replacing the dollar any time soon.
