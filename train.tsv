713	714	Informational	They are fearful but ultimately, for the Ukrainians, it wouldn't be worth it. If they get back all territory taken by the Russians, you could easily see the Ukrainians digging in. They now have the capabilities to stop an invasion force massing on their border.

717	718	Persuasive	The arbitrary squiggle when British American cartographers drew there own map at the end of world war 2 is the basis of what you consider to be a nation.  The truth is the other nations are identical to yours. They are a variant of you.   If invaders come to your home town, let's talk again, but until then remember that the shape of the squiggle on a map isn't worth killing for and isn't worth dying for.
294	295	Persuasive	Yes please start sooner rather than later to prevent more genocide and crimes against humanity.   Just recently, we have seen the woman abductor of children on a plane a while ago. Arrest her and put her into trial immediately, they need to see people punished to make them think that they can't just do anything now. All the evidence is in the video, this is a case that can be closed immediately.
290	291	Informational	Looking on google maps, this doesn't seem to affect Russia whatsoever.  The west side of China is simply connecting to Kyrgyzstand, with which it shares a border.  The line then connects to an existing line already in Uzbekistan.  This is nowhere even close to Russia. The giant country of Kazakhstan lies north of all this, after which is Russia.  What does Russia even have anything to do with this?  Might as well say it bypasses India.

705	706	Humorous	I guess this means the Russians don't consider NATO that much of a threat to them
323	324	Informational	&gt;Today was the anniversary of the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland. The Second World War began with a Nazi-Soviet alliance. It is illegal to say so in Russia.

Because it's popular to take a stance of superiority against conspiracy theorists?   Unfortunately, satanic ritual abuse is a real thing, and if any of you did your homework properly before assuming you know what's right and wrong simply by your magically 100% correct intuition, you'd already know that.

364	365	Persuasive	As an Aussie with a couple ex-Russian friends, I think we should continue to allow tourist in a limited capacity. It gives them a better chance to see what is wrong with their own government by comparison with our current government. Although I don't think this approach has been working in Europe enough to outweigh the costs, but it seems that if there are a limited number of tourist they will mingle more with the local population. Hmm I suppose my Russian friends didn't come here as tourists, so not sure if tourist have the same effect. Also my friends may not be like your standard Russian's as they hate hanging out with Russian's here (although they still hate most of American culture).    The only costs to allowing tourists seems to be is not showing solidarity with Ukraine and not penalising Russian Civilian's for not uprising against Putin. Uprisings are not easy work, especially when half of your country has been brainwashed.

992	993	Informational	"&gt;Sherman's March to the Sea (also known as the Savannah campaign or simply Sherman's March) was a military campaign of the American Civil War conducted through Georgia from November 15 until December 21, 1864, by William Tecumseh Sherman, major general of the Union Army.       &gt;   &gt;The campaign began with Sherman's troops leaving the captured city of Atlanta on November 15 and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21.       &gt;   &gt;His forces followed a ""scorched earth"" policy, destroying military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property and persons, disrupting the Confederacy's economy and transportation networks.       &gt;   &gt;The operation debilitated the Confederacy and helped lead to its eventual surrender.       &gt;   &gt;Sherman's decision to operate deep within enemy territory without supply lines was unusual for its time, and the campaign is taught by some historians as an early example of modern warfare or total war.   &gt;   &gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s\_March\_to\_the\_Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea)"
670	671	Informational	So Mexico has fallen into the Contrarianism as a political movement trap. The disease du jour. Russia made a huge investment that might yet pay off if we don't fight against it. The problem is that it requires no intellectual ability and no agenda. Just, we zig when they zag. What the opposite of your thing is, that's our thing. You like democracy. We think it's corrupt. You like human rights? We reject your conventions. You like regulations? We deregulate. You have a plan? We hate it! But you don't even know what it is! Doesn't matter, we're the party of nothing.

57	58	Persuasive	The cold war tactics in here are insane, with many angles.   Armenia wants to be in US sphere, but is stuck in Russian sphere because they got screwed by previous leaders.   Iran wants to stay connected to Armenia on the southern border, because Armenia is their connect on the silk road (iirc) and they connect to the EU through Armenia and don't have to deal with Azer/Turkey.   Azer/Turkey want pan turkism to fully connect and finalize their genocide against armenians, while cozying up with Russia.   Russia gets an underground backchannel with Azeri/Turkey, while not trying to bother that relationship by supporting Armenia, after putting in shitty situation after shitty situation back to the days of the ussr.   MY BIGGEST tinfoil in all this is that the US/Iran need Armenia to stay as is (with that southern border connected) because talks of the nuclear deal are heating up.   We saw confirmed military shipments from Israel to Baku today, because Israel surely wants to screw Iran over and support Azerbaijan and Iran confirmed Israel is using Azerbaijan territory to spy.

Well recently I haven't been able to do that, as most of the posts he's made have been long, rambling rants making fun of Russian leadership and it seems at this point he has had some sort of small mental break. It seems that he has admitted to himself at least somewhat that his work has failed, he repeatedly has lambasted Russian leadership and believes wholeheartedly that the war is lost unless Russia fully mobilizes their reserves and economy, even he admits this is unlikely due to lack of general support.   Only useful information is this, Ukraine maintains it's bridgehead across the Inhulets river, west of Kherson, despite Russian efforts to dislodge them. He even reports that Ukraine has managed to take back the village of Mala Seidemynukha in this area and push the front back in other areas.   It's hard to find info on this village, but it's less than 100 acres and the population is likely fewer than 200. **This information does not compromise Ukrainian OPSEC as the information is publicly sourced from strictly Russian sources.**"

They built up an arsenal of weapons for this war since that day when Armenia took Susha.   It's an ethnic war.   The people who are pro Armenia is conveniently overlooking that they took lands from Azerbaijan.   Azerbaijan war atrocities is bad  but they're painting it as if Armenia is the good guy. It ain't black and white.  I'm more surprise why Armenia didn't keep up with their defensive since 1992. While Azerbaijan bought tons of weapons.   Also it's a shit spin on dictator.  It's like justifying Iraq invasion cause he's a dictator after not finding weapon of mass destruction. Also don't circle back about Azerbaijan starting this, they want their land back.   It's a fucking ethnic war. Europe should send their peace keeper.   The most USA should do is broker some peace deal. We shouldn't be picking side on a fucking ethnic war. We should stop them if there is a genocide but not when they're fighting for a piece of land.

I think Russia had the upper hand in some partisan or UA spec ops engagement. Ukraine probably was running an operation and Russia stopped it but UA slipped away.  If Russia stopped a serious operation, we'd see bodies. If it was infighting, UA's intelligence network would have let us know with recordings and data.  If this was staged, Russia has outclassed every previous piece of staged prop. Their bad stagings are even a running joke here.  Russia probably thought they had the upper hand which is why they leaked it. They were unable to finish the job though which is why they clammed up. Ukraine has no reason to comment.

370	371	Persuasive	That's maybe too simple and a convenient take for NATO countries. Take a Chinese initiative that further diminishes the Need for western logistics and make it sound anti Russian . Clearly Brazil China Russia and India are all trying to break from US and NATO economic influence. The most impactful way is to connect the world via Land routes which would benefit everyone. Except maybe the countries that rely mostly on sea trade routes.   You can pretend this is not about geopolitics, by making claims on efficiency on sea routes but logistical practice will easily crumble that argument. The lack of direct routes for example, the back tracking and transfers etc are too ridiculous to be called efficient.   So this is geopolitical but then you have to admit China has no need to put maneuver Russia when it comes to trade routes. They are more in competition with the ‘Western' world.

61	62	Persuasive	The thing the worlds needs most right now, is for Donald J. Trump to be charged and imprisoned for high treason, corruption and god knows what other crimes he has committed.  His piss-poor leadership, and crusade on dismantling western unity and American standing in the world is what allowed this conflict to happen in the first place (both indirectly, and directly by blackmailing Ukraine). Along with making authoritarian countries confident enough to openly challenge the west with their new alliances (which are luckily, so far a complete joke, but if the west keeps derailing they might become a threat).  This is just what happens when the only superpower allows an orange moron to take the wheels.

Predictable in a ruthless sort of way.   Obviously, they aren't using the exact same logic as western liberal democracies. The whole border shit with India strikes me as needlessly provocative to a country that isn't, necessarily, in the western camp.

In DDay the Luftwaffe - Germanys Air Force - was nonexistent after the fight w Russia.  With Taiwan, they have a substantive and modern Air Force and air defense system.  In DDay, the Allie's were invading a willing territory of France under resistance that could provide support.  The Taiwanese have been preparing to defend the island for 70 years.  In DDay the attacking forces were already battle tested, both from experience in WWI and WWII. The Chinese have not been in a war, especially where they had to attack someone — ever.  The Chinese have no blue water Navy to consolidate their attack on Taiwan — they have 2 used air craft carriers from Russia.  The US alone has 15 super carriers capable of operating anywhere in the world.  The list goes on.  The Chinese would need more than 2 million troops to land on Taiwan, take it and keep it.  DDay, as big as it was, sent 156,000.

Why should Ukraine accept a ceasefire where millions of people are under Russia's jurisdiction, when they are on land recognized by the international community to be part of Ukraine.
