"This is a misleading title.  This was planned 25 years ago originally and it's just something they formerly signed recently.  The title makes it seem like it's a slight on Russia, which it isn't.

May as well say it bypasses India as well."

&gt; &amp;quot;Violating the reached agreements, the Tajik side renewed gunfire at Kyrgyz border guards&amp;#039; positions in the settlements of Kulundu and Jany-Jer in the Leilek district,&amp;quot; the border service said, adding that the Tajik side used multiple rocket launchers against positions in the Batken district.

&gt; Border issues in Central Asia stem to a large extent from the Soviet era when Moscow tried to divide the region between ethnic groups whose settlements were often located amidst those of other ethnicities.

&gt; Kyrgyzstan&amp;#039;s southern Batken Province, which borders Tajikistan&amp;#039;s northern Sughd region and features a Tajik exclave, Vorukh, has been a key hotspot in recent conflicts.

"Misleading headline; this decision wasn't about Russia or sanctions.

The article states that China had been negotiating for *years* (read: before 2022) to extend its existing railroad through Kyrgyzstan.

It also points out that this route to Europe is 900km shorter than a hypothetical route through Russia. This is simply a sound logistical decision. It's implied that there was never an option on the table about going through Russia."

Ooohhhh yeah. Fuck me up with that new thread. Here we go boys
anyone who have studied war, when the invaders are retreating you must follow and defeat them at their own land if need be, otherwise they will just regroup and come back later.  Letting a invading army leave without punishment will just allow them to rearm and come back later.  Finish your enemy when they are down
He ain't special, I've got flushable toilet paper rolls too.

"I hate the phrasing of this articles title.

"The cold war tactics in here are insane, with many angles. 

Armenia wants to be in US sphere, but is stuck in Russian sphere because they got screwed by previous leaders. 

Iran wants to stay connected to Armenia on the southern border, because Armenia is their connect on the silk road (iirc) and they connect to the EU through Armenia and don‚Äôt have to deal with Azer/Turkey. 

Azer/Turkey want pan turkism to fully connect and finalize their genocide against armenians, while cozying up with Russia. 

Russia gets an underground backchannel with Azeri/Turkey, while not trying to bother that relationship by supporting Armenia, after putting in shitty situation after shitty situation back to the days of the ussr. 

MY BIGGEST tinfoil in all this is that the US/Iran need Armenia to stay as is (with that southern border connected) because talks of the nuclear deal are heating up. 

We saw confirmed military shipments from Israel to Baku today, because Israel surely wants to screw Iran over and support Azerbaijan and Iran confirmed Israel is using Azerbaijan territory to spy."
"The only deal acceptable is for Russia to leave Ukraine and respect the at pre 2014 borders.
Pay Ukraine for destruction and rebuilding.
Russia just go home as no one likes you anymore."
After reading the comments here it seems like a lot of mexicans are expressing the notion that Mexico has a generally pro-russia outlook.  Could a mexican here kindly explain to me the roots of Russia‚Äôs pro-Russia stance?  I had no idea.
Watch out guys, if Putin gets any angrier he might assassinate another one of his oligarch cronies. Wouldn't that be horrible?!
"The thing the worlds needs most right now, is for Donald J. Trump to be charged and imprisoned for high treason, corruption and god knows what other crimes he has committed.

His piss-poor leadership, and crusade on dismantling western unity and American standing in the world is what allowed this conflict to happen in the first place (both indirectly, and directly by blackmailing Ukraine). Along with making authoritarian countries confident enough to openly challenge the west with their new alliances (which are luckily, so far a complete joke, but if the west keeps derailing they might become a threat).

This is just what happens when the only superpower allows an orange moron to take the wheels."
Well; those who are focusing on the wall, China and Russia have been meeting over years to create a new Panama Canal cutting through Nicaragua!!  While they have been distracting the US and EU with the BS in Ukraine, it is subterfuge to what is really happening below. The GOP knows this, thank you Trump asset, that this has been the agenda for years. The fact the Xi Xi , Putler, Iran, and N. Korea has beef working in collaboration isn‚Äôt really a surprise, is it!!??? If it is, US and EU , we‚Äôre fucked!!
Those fighters gonna rust out from disuse lmao
When Russia restores all of Ukraine, including Crimea, then maybe such a thing can take place.  Ukraine then has time to ascend into NATO status, and after, nothing can touch them.

No kidding. The Russians would leave a bomb in a bassinet if they thought it would cause a little more suffering.
Putin is probably just tricking Ukraine into believing he is going to end the conflict in between them. Once they come into an agreement to end the war and Ukraine let‚Äôs it‚Äôs guard down, Putin‚Äôs military will attack them unexpectedly. You do not trust nor negotiate with terrorist.

I really hope we are training Ukrainian's on newer Patriot systems right now. Ukraine's intercept rate with current defenses seems to be about 50% right now. With Russia threatening to go scorched earth and take out civilian infrastructure we need to make sure Ukraine is better capable of being able to defend itself from Cruise missiles.

"If the senator from Mexico thinks that Russia has legitimate reason to be in Ukraine protecting Russians from the ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù in Ukraine, Does the USA have a legit reason to invade and genocide the innocent Mexicans because of the drug cartels?

Just follow the Minsk agreement and recognise the autonomy of LPR and DPR and we can all be done with it.

No better way to ruin Russo-Indian relations than to flood India with obnoxious Russian tourist.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khojaly_massacre

You know why Azerbaijan is this hateful? That happened in 1992. They built up an arsenal of weapons for this war since that day when Armenia took Susha. 

It's an ethnic war. 

The people who are pro Armenia is conveniently overlooking that they took lands from Azerbaijan. 

Azerbaijan war atrocities is bad  but they're painting it as if Armenia is the good guy. It ain't black and white.

I'm more surprise why Armenia didn't keep up with their defensive since 1992. While Azerbaijan bought tons of weapons. 

Also it's a shit spin on dictator.

It's like justifying Iraq invasion cause he's a dictator after not finding weapon of mass destruction. Also don't circle back about Azerbaijan starting this, they want their land back.

"The Counsellors of State are composed of the spouse of the monarch plus the first four people in line for the throne who are over 21 years of age and they are basically authorized to stand in for the monarch under various circumstances. With the queen's death, Beatrice just joined that group; she'll be replaced by George when he's old enough and then Charlotte will knock Andrew out when she's old enough; Harry will be replaced by Louis.  It may be that Charles is looking to modify who can be Counsellor of State such as adding a restriction of working royals to that but I don't know if there'd be four such unless you start including spouses who technically aren't in line for the throne. (Harry, Andrew, and Beatrice are not working royals whereas Kate and Anne are.) Charles also wants fewer working royals so, again, not quite sure what's the eventual plan there.

Now, I'm not sure how all this intersects b/c as I understand it, let's take Andrew as an example. He's a member of the Counsellors of State because he's in line for the throne. But he's not a working royal (look for that blue sash) since his mother stripped him of all duties and public representation. And I've already mentioned working royals who are not close enough in line of succession to be in the Counsellors (or not in succession at all) but absolutely represent the monarch at various events.

As for the queen's approval, it's been known for a number of years that Charles intends to streamline the number of working royals, so she certainly was aware of his plans. (And of course at this point, her approval or not is completely moot.)"

As an Australian I'm rather embarrassed that we haven't yet reopened our Kyiv Embassy. Many other countries have long since reopened their embassies and as always we are behind the pack. In this case it also looks cowardly.
Cheap Russian gas is attractive, but now there is too much blood, deportations, war, and genocide that makes that resource from Russia accept all those violations. This means it's impossible to make any deals with Russia until they have left Ukraine and Crimea and have come up with a solution to cover damages to Ukraine, Europe and other countries that suffered. That won‚Äôt be easy.

Finnish public broadcaster [Yle reports that Russia has moved AA missiles from St. Petersburg for use in Ukraine](https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-12588962). (Article in Finnish, but it has self-explanatory scrubbable before/after satellite pictures) There are 14 anti-air defence bases around St. Petersburg, four of which have been emptied of missiles. The moved systems are S-300s, most likely used as cruise missiles to bomb Ukraine.
Looking on google maps, this doesn't seem to affect Russia whatsoever.  The west side of China is simply connecting to Kyrgyzstand, with which it shares a border.  The line then connects to an existing line already in Uzbekistan.  This is nowhere even close to Russia. The giant country of Kazakhstan lies north of all this, after which is Russia.  What does Russia even have anything to do with this?  Might as well say it bypasses India.
"The reality of Kherson street fighting likely lies in the middle of all the claims. Both sides seem to have disliked like the outcome since everyone clammed up. I think Russia had the upper hand in some partisan or UA spec ops engagement. Ukraine probably was running an operation and Russia stopped it but UA slipped away.

If Russia stopped a serious operation, we‚Äôd see bodies. If it was infighting, UA‚Äôs intelligence network would have let us know with recordings and data.

If this was staged, Russia has outclassed every previous piece of staged prop. Their bad stagings are even a running joke here.

Russia probably thought they had the upper hand which is why they leaked it. They were unable to finish the job though which is why they clammed up. Ukraine has no reason to comment."

"As an Aussie with a couple ex-Russian friends, I think we should continue to allow tourist in a limited capacity. It gives them a better chance to see what is wrong with their own government by comparison with our current government.

Hmm I suppose my Russian friends didn't come here as tourists, so not sure if tourist have the same effect. Also my friends may not be like your standard Russian's as they hate hanging out with Russian's here (although they still hate most of American culture).  
The only costs to allowing tourists seems to be is not showing solidarity with Ukraine and not penalising Russian Civilian's for not uprising against Putin. Uprisings are not easy work, especially when half of your country has been brainwashed."

"That‚Äôs maybe too simple and a convenient take for NATO countries. Take a Chinese initiative that further diminishes the Need for western logistics and make it sound anti Russian . Clearly Brazil China Russia and India are all trying to break from US and NATO economic influence. The most impactful way is to connect the world via Land routes which would benefit everyone. Except maybe the countries that rely mostly on sea trade routes. 

You can pretend this is not about geopolitics, by making claims on efficiency on sea routes but logistical practice will easily crumble that argument. The lack of direct routes for example, the back tracking and transfers etc are too ridiculous to be called efficient. 

So this is geopolitical but then you have to admit China has no need to put maneuver Russia when it comes to trade routes. They are more in competition with the ‚ÄòWestern‚Äô world. The same western world which is fighting Russia down to the last Ukrainian so to speak."

&gt; The EU is &amp;quot;Deeply shocked&amp;quot; at the discovery by Ukrainian officials of mass graves in the recaptured city of Izium, the bloc&amp;#039;s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Friday.

&gt; &amp;quot;This inhuman behaviour by the Russian forces, in total disregard of international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions, must stop immediately.On Thursday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Russian president Vladimir Putin to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine.In Washington, US president Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin against using chemical or tactical nuclear weapons after serious losses in his war in Ukraine.&amp;quot;Don&amp;#039;t.

&gt; Iranian Shahed-136 drones supplied to Russia carried out several devastating strikes on Ukrainian troops.

&gt; In his brigade&amp;#039;s operational area alone, the Iranian drones have destroyed two 152-mm self-propelled howitzers, two 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, as well as two BTR armored infantry vehicles, he said.

&gt; The Iranian drones seem to have been mostly deployed in the Kharkiv region, where the 92nd Brigade and other Ukrainian forces carried out a major offensive this month.

&gt; TOKYO - A powerful typhoon approaching southern Japan pounded the region with strong winds and heavy rain Sunday, causing blackouts, paralyzed ground and air transportation and the evacuation of thousands of people.

&gt; The Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Nanmadol was near the southern island of Yakushima, packing maximum surface winds of 162 kilometers per hour, as it slowly headed north to the country&amp;#039;s main southern island of Kyushu where it could make a landfall later Sunday.

&gt; Kyushu Electric Power Co. said more than 93,000 homes across the Kyushu island were without electricity Sunday because of damage to power lines and facilities.

Americans are failing to understand that the world is making a hard turn against their consensus. The press questions out loud ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the rest of the world joining us in condemning Russia? Why are they not participating in our sanctions?‚Äù The people they are referring to are the ‚Äòglobal south‚Äô which Mexico stands with, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, ETC.  Don‚Äôt take this as an anti American question, but instead try to understand why entire blocs of nations are not standing with Ukraine and just embracing their narrative. You might learn a thing or two about America which you know in the back of your mind but are not fully accepting: American power is on the decline.

"I often like to report to people what Igor Girkin (Russian war criminal that helped to create the terrorist ""State"" of the DPR in Ukraine) is talking about on his Telegram so others don't have to go on it.

Well recently I haven't been able to do that, as most of the posts he's made have been long, rambling rants making fun of Russian leadership and it seems at this point he has had some sort of small mental break. It seems that he has admitted to himself at least somewhat that his work has failed, he repeatedly has lambasted Russian leadership and believes wholeheartedly that the war is lost unless Russia fully mobilizes their reserves and economy, even he admits this is unlikely due to lack of general support. 

Only useful information is this, Ukraine maintains it's bridgehead across the Inhulets river, west of Kherson, despite Russian efforts to dislodge them. He even reports that Ukraine has managed to take back the village of Mala Seidemynukha in this area and push the front back in other areas. 

It's hard to find info on this village, but it's less than 100 acres and the population is likely fewer than 200. **This information does not compromise Ukrainian OPSEC as the information is publicly sourced from strictly Russian sources.**"

No. Dollar dominance is structural. If global trade and finance still operates the way it is today,  then nothing is diminishing the US dollar.
I'm unsure why anyone should be surprised, war means mass killings and you either bury the bodies, take them away or leave them where they fell.  The exhumations will tell how they died and maybe provide identification and evidence for prosecutions.

&gt; Ukraine has not given any indication that it intends to cross the border or do more than retake territory occupied by Russia.

&gt; &amp;#039;Always on guard in case of new attacks&amp;#039; is the mindset of the increasing number of civilians who are volunteering to defend Armenia agaist Azerbaijan&amp;#039;s forces.

&gt; The volunteer&amp;#039;s training is led by Voma, the largest paramilitary group in the country.

&gt; &amp;quot;We want to test their ability to fight back against the enemy because none of the volunteers have military experience. I am stressed because the majority of the people in this country are not ready and do not want to train and this small group cannot defend our country&amp;quot;.

&gt; Despite the shelling, a small group of soldiers winds its way along a rutted mud track to where a dead Ukrainian combatant lies, spotted by a drone used to search for bodies and shallow graves.

&gt; The nearby village of Kozacha Lopan, whose edge lies less than two kilometers from the Russian border, was retaken by Ukrainian forces Sept. 11.Vitalii said the team is also hunting for graves of possible vicitms of what authorities say was a makeshift prison where detainees were abused.

&gt; Burial sites have been found in some areas where Russian forces were pushed out, most notably in the city of Izium, where Ukrainian officials say more than 440 graves have been found near the city&amp;#039;s cemetery.

&gt; Security chiefs of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sat down for talks to stop fighting on the border between the two countries that have so far killed 54 people and wounded more than 100.

&gt; Tajikistan has not given any official casualty numbers, but security sources said 30 people had been killed this week, including 15 who were in a mosque that Tajikistan said was struck by a Kyrgyz drone.

&gt; Tajikistan&amp;#039;s security officials said Kyrgyzstan was amassing troops and military equipment near the border in preparation for provocations.

"Russia pulling back its anti-air missile defences from the Finnish border. Which means one of the following or all of them:

1. Russia is running out of missiles and needs to scrap together more from anywhere, like using SSM capable AA missile systems. Russia has already been using anti-ship missiles against land targets, and the S-300 in the ground attack role. 
2. Russia has lost so much of its AA capability in Ukraine that it needs to bring in more even from high-priority areas, increasingly cannibalizing its priority defence capability to keep fighting in Ukraine. 
3. Russia simply needs more AA capability yet for some reason didn't bother to bring these in for the invasion or any time earlier during the invasion. 

I think #1 is the most likely explanation. They have limited stockpiles, they have limited capability to make more especially now with sanctions, they have used a lot of them on pointless terrorism, Ukraine has been getting better at shooting them down, and even when they are used against valid targets, the keyword in Russian missile is ""miss"". Russia will always keep a few advanced missiles in the reserve if they have any sense left, so I doubt Russia will literally run out, but they certainly can't afford to keep up a constant missile bombardment. 

Also, Russia being willing to take away missile defences from so close to the border in one of their top priority areas shows yet again that all their claims of the threat of NATO are nonsense."

" TAIPEI (Taiwan News) ‚Äî The deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) says Chinese leader Xi Jinping (ÁøíËøëÂπ≥) wants the military to be ready to invade Taiwan in 2027, though he will not necessarily order the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) to do so, reports said Saturday (Sept. 17).

CNN intelligence and national security correspondent Katie Bo Lillis tweeted that CIA Deputy Director David Cohen had told her Xi wants ‚Äúto have the capability to take control of Taiwan by force by 2027.‚Äù However, he added that the United States intelligence community did not believe Xi had already reached a decision about when to launch an invasion.

Xi ‚Äúhas asked his military to put him in a position where, if that‚Äôs what he wanted to do, he would be able to,‚Äù Lillis quoted Cohen as saying. The CIA official said the Chinese leader still preferred to ‚Äúget control through nonmilitary means,‚Äù the CNN correspondent tweeted.

American Military News reported that U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley last year attributed the date of 2027 to a speech by Xi. The Communist leader told the PLA to ramp up its modernization in order to be able to seize Taiwan in 2027 instead of in 2035, Milley told Congress.

The top U.S. general also emphasized that Xi wanted the capability, but had not reached a decision to launch an attack."

&gt; BRUSSELS, Sept 18 - The European Union executive is expected to recommend on Sunday suspending billions of euros in funds for Hungary over corruption, the first such case in the bloc under a new &amp;quot;Cash for democracy&amp;quot; sanction meant to better protect the rule of law.

&gt; The Commission is already blocking some 6 billion euros in funds envisaged for Hungary in a separate COVID economic recovery stimulus, saying the money would otherwise be at risk of being misused.

&gt; Hungary had irregularities in nearly 4% of EU funds spending in 2015-2019, according to the bloc&amp;#039;s anti-fraud body OLAF, by far the worst result among the 27 EU countries.

&gt; Even before moving anti-aircraft missiles from St Petersburg, Russia appears to have moved missiles to the front from bases located closer to Ukraine and from areas considered less important than St Petersburg.

&gt; In its war against Ukraine, Russia has hardly had to use anti-aircraft missiles for their actual purpose, which is destroying missiles, aircraft or helicopters, because there has been little air combat over Ukraine.

&gt; Although Russia is struggling to produce enough new missiles for its war on Ukraine, it still has enough of the newer S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to export.

&gt; Police and community leaders in Leicester are calling for calm as they deal with &amp;quot;Disorder&amp;quot; on the streets, which has bubbled over again following an India v Pakistan cricket match last month.

&gt; &amp;quot;Speaking on a Twitter video on Saturday, Leicestershire Police temporary chief constable Rob Nixon said:&amp;quot;We have had numerous reports of an outbreak of disorder in parts of the East Leicester area of the city.

&gt; Leicester MP Claudia Webbe also called for calm and urged people on the streets to go home.

Why would people rush to live near areas with land mines?!
Well what's the 2nd highest number?
This last Christmas my wife and I made chorizo filled pierogis in an attempt to mix our respective heritages. What a naive fool I‚Äôd been all this time.
Oh fun. I'm a foreigner in China. I'm going to amuse myself by trying to shake hands with people all week.
As a foreigner living in China this pleases me. I like getting a seat in the metro and prefer to take lifts alone.
I cannot swallow a small pill and this woman was able to do so with 55 batteries, lol.
Pretty late, but good!
What kind of missiles are these?
I hope so, but this is whisfull thinking....what about MH17? He was having a good laugh about it...that Irkin person is still on duty managing masacres in Ukraine
"If Russia isn't supplying gas to Europe what are they doing with their supply?
Its not something you can just turn off and then on again.
How long until there are more flair stacks venting gas to keep the pressure levels down?"
The Ukrainians would only need to target military infrastructure and supplies. Once the Russian military gets desperate, they‚Äôll gladly loot their own people.
I would recommend going there having a beer in the Brouwerij De Molen, a local brewery located in an old windmill.

"I love how they say it as if there is just a massive record that only doctors have access to for everything you can think of.

Just imagining them finally finishing removing all the batteries and they're like ""holy shit is that 55? that's a new record for batteries I think, holy shit!"" and the theatre erupts in applause."
Who the fuck are they gonna bomb with those F-35s? Italian hikers lost on their side of the alps?
After a month I don't think it's about a cricket match anymore. Seems the nationalism from India and Pakistan is affecting their communities abroad.

That is really quite funny ‚Äî it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs being childish at this point. Throwing his toys out of the pram and refusing to open Nord Stream 1, then goading us to open Nord Stream 2.
The most astonishing thing about this entire thing to me is the absolute state of russian society. There seems to be not an ounce of empathy present in public discourse. People straight up don‚Äôt give a fuck unless it affects them directly. They could have relatives in Ukraine straight up telling them what‚Äôs happening and they chose to believe TV propaganda instead.
I thought Germany already cancelled NS2? I doubt NS2 happens if Germany isn't onboard
Sounds like it's more fir corruption than fir damaging democracy.  The fact that corruption damages democracy is not lost on me btw.
"Just put this in perspective, when these RCH-155 howitzers and the Pzh2000 Howtizers are delivered, these weapon systems alone, will be able to fire 13.000 rounds per day, twice the daily number of rounds the UAF shoots these days.  
  
And these will be precision strikes too. Since they have digital linkup they can be integrated with advanced counter battery radars like the Thales Cobra, meaning they can fire counter battery fire, even before the enemy rounds have hit the ground."

Oh no. We don't need Taiwan to have a power grid blackout.
Yes foreigners. And Chinese people who travel. But i guess it's much easier to point to the outside group. We all love to do that don't we.
Calls are growing to arm Ukraine with nuclear weapons.
99% sure they wouldn't but that 1% of possibility is what Russia will use as misinformation to make the populace fearful and boost recruiting efforts.
This post should have used the article's title, far more entising than what OP chose.
"East Asian countries are some of the most ignorant, xenophobic, and racist countries in the world. 

I live in Korea and there was a covid outbreak amongst foreign factory workers (you know the type of workers who are forced to live in absolute squalor by their Korean bosses). As a result, the Korean government ordered a mandate requiring ALL foreigners residing in Korea to get tested immediately or receive a fine. lol"
I wonder if Guangzhou will kick foreigners out of their apartments to live in the street again, like during Covid.
Peace talks with Russia? How many times did they break ceasefire agreements?
I feel like a stranger in my own Country. Is this the UK I was born into ?  I no longer recognise it.
"Mexican here. I obviously can‚Äôt confirm this, but it sounds 10000000000% feasible and possible. Specially with the current government. Let me explain why.

Basically from my experience, there is A FUCKING TON of hate towards the US and the West in general. Like, A LOT of deep rooted hatred towards the US.

There is a lot of people who still genuinely feel deep rage and anger over the US annexation of former Mexican territory or the Spanish conquest of native indigenous civilizations (even if modern Mexicans treat native indigenous peoples horribly themselves).

Therefore A LOT of people will support LITERALLY anything that goes against American and Western interests.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Hitler or the devil himself, actually, it doesn‚Äôt even matter if it goes directly against Mexican interests either, as long as it goes against the US and the ‚Äúevil‚Äù West, A TON of people will blindly support it."
Hilarious how Hungary now wants to implement an anti corruption campaign. Not  likely to be very efficient or credible when the government is the main cause of corruption
To be fair, China is a famously hygienic country with no record of causing disease.
This Nord company really is getting a lot of influencer backing
Xi is not learning from the mistakes Russia is making. Instead of trying to invade Taiwan with a shitty military which shares some of the same weakness as the Russian ones, Xi needs to handle his own domestic problems.
All charged up with no place to go.
I can't help but feel a million bots are shutting down anyone who calls for peace.
Wouldn‚Äôt Poland just block the vote? Anyone more informed could elaborate on this?
So Armenia will get weapons now?
More like 2023. 2027 smells like bullshit to me. Xi has been waiting to pounce on taiwan but has withheld doing so based on current economic conditions and how Russia is getting their ass handed to them in Ukraine
 If someone threatens you with a stick pick a stick up, you have a 50% chance of survival and a 90% chance of nothing happening, time to arm Ukraine with nuclear weapons.
Can‚Äôt just somebody invade us please?
and just like that David Blaine just announces his new show
"Unfortunatrlly the government proposed anti corruption body is currently set-up by some of our most corrupt ministers.
Shame if any money is given. EU already for 10 years was watching and sponsoring Orban' regime with ample amlunt of money for them to steal.

We have municipalities frained by Orban and they are falling as wrll on local elections to them. Pribably direct financing of municipalities instead of government would be better in this case..."
So Mexico has chosen to side with Russia.  Maybe we should sanction them as well. Disgusting.

Technically, it is not unwarranted, but probably not.

Mexico going to the dark side? The last thing they should want is a fractured/weakened USA which might end up with a Putin-sequence approach to its southern neighbor.

The EU needs to develop a mechanism for removing countries like Hungary. The same goes for NATO.
"&gt; Satellite images obtained by Yle indicate that Russia has been moving a large number of anti-aircraft missiles toward Ukraine, including from as far away as St. Petersburg, one of the most crucial areas for Russian air defence.

Russia really must be running out of missiles if they are moving them away from crucial areas for their domestic air defense."

So close to home, I hope everyone there is okay. I really hope everyone evacuated in time.
"CCP really fucked themselves with zero covid policy which they imposed to the world. Lets not forget millions are still in lockdown in China because their government can't acknowledge their mistakes.

"Has anybody here actually looked at any evidence and unequivocally proven that it's not true? No? So why call it conspiracy theory and not just regular allegation? 

Because it's popular to take a stance of superiority against conspiracy theorists? 

Unfortunately, satanic ritual abuse is a real thing, and if any of you did your homework properly before assuming you know what's right and wrong simply by your magically 100% correct intuition, you'd already know that. 

There are real people suffering because of this, and think how they must feel when people call what happened to them conspiracy theory without even looking into it for themself. 

You owe these people an apology.

*As reported, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that more than 400 bodies, including those with signs of torture, had been found in a mass grave in liberated Izium. Children and military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are among those identified.*

"**Full Transcript Below:**

*17.09.2022 23:59*

*President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he is ready to allow Russia to supply ammonia via Ukraine if the Russian Federation releases Ukrainian prisoners of war.*  
*Zelensky made the statement in an interview with Reuters, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.*  
  
*""In a choice between dignity and money, I choose dignity. I wouldn‚Äôt want to trade with the Russian Federation, and I wouldn‚Äôt like anyone to trade and get Russian ammonia, I‚Äôll tell you frankly... I will be really frank with you - I said that I would be against ammonia supplies from the Russian Federation via Ukraine. I‚Äôm willing to go for it only if we exchange the supply of ammonia for our prisoners. I proposed this to the UN,"" the president said.*  
  
*Answering the question of what steps he would like to be taken by the participants in the UN General Assembly session regarding the war with the Russian Federation, Zelensky opined that certain discussions among the leaders would continue there, that certain documents would be adopted, and that ""the prime minister, the minister of foreign affairs... they know their job.""*  
  
*Read also: Zelensky on torture, airstrikes in Izium: ‚ÄúI don't know how many thousands died there‚Äù*  
*""I think it is important to raise two points as high as possible on the agenda among the leaders and achieve a result. The first is still to find the right mechanism, and to support the resolution regarding it, for asset return, refunds from the occupiers, etc. We really need this mechanism but it doesn‚Äôt exist yet,"" Zelensky said.*  
  
*Another step he called the resolution on the creation of a special tribunal for war crimes and those who committed these crimes.*  
  
*""Separately in the USA, it is necessary, probably at the level of the UN platform, to also discuss the issue of recognizing the Russian Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism. This is also a very important step,"" he said.*  
  
*Among other important issues relevant to Ukraine, the president mentioned the budget deficit, the significant need to resolve certain issues with the IMF, and the need to agree on a new cooperation program. According to Zelensky, ""we have started this work.""*  
  
*""The USA and the UN are a good platform to this end as well. So there are many things to focus on,"" he clarified.*  
  
*As reported, reports emerged in the Western media claiming that the UN is putting pressure on Ukraine and the Russian Federation in order to restore the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa pipeline for further export of ammonia via the Black Sea as part of the ""grain initiative.""*  
  
*For his part, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Ukraine will learn the details of the UN initiative to restore the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline and that it will make no decision that would be against the country‚Äôs interests.*"
Good. Makes them easier to destroy.
Some people make piles of shit, some make shit of piles.

Pica is fucking weird
"""After seven months of cease fire, mexican government calls for peace the moment ukraine is having the momentum""  all that needs to be said, meh"
"The comments under the article about M√©xico's ""peace plan"" make me roll my eyes so hard. As a latina, I must say most reddit users don't represent the community, they tend to be *much* more conservative and upper class.

The reason why AMLO did this is mostly... Because he wanted to be seen doing ""something"" without actually doing anything. This is 100% Latam go-to maneuver. Condemn violence and war, but try to not take any concrete action; say how you wish this violence/war would end soon (yes, even if it's an invasion and it's dumb to propose this). It's just how politicians here roll, and AMLO isn't a very competent president, so you can expect even less from him."
Someone should explain to her how a vibrator actually works
"I'll be honest I've no idea how big the ammonia market is. If this can save lives and bring men and women home then it is a good thing. 

I know of ammonia from using it in the gym in the form of smelling salts. 

Hopefully Russia will at least discuss the matter and possible agree to this as well."
But it also gives Ukraine/US time to beef up the defense force too.
Regroup with what?!
Doubt anything will come out of it, turkey will sweep it under the rug
And then get out of NATO at last. No one needs you there.
"All investments in the Russian dictatorship was lost.

China is next: you don't invest in China, you give away money, you'll never get anything back.

Stop investing i dictators. Stop fuelling wars on democracies.

Maybe we should simply ban investment and trade with countries like China."
We'r talking about AAA or AA batteries?
Russia will loose no matter what. Their people don't want to be there, there's nothing for them other than fear. If Putin is dumb enough as he as shown, this war will collapse their entire party.
"For a countey rhar has suffered several wars of occupation, lost more than half its territory and experienced genocide they are acting in a most shameful way. 

Mexico should be the first one to demand Ruzzia to withdraw."
It's not that astonishing from the inside, this has almost happened for years now
"This post is fucked up, especially from the absolute asinine Mexicans around here. 

* The current president is LOATHED by the right wing followers in Mexico, but then again, not by the majority of the country, which is why AMLO won and his party is winning every state that before had a long history of ultra-conservative politicians. 

* Reddit is an obscure social media platform in Mexico and, it‚Äôs been proven, that most Mexican Redditors are right wing conservatives, taking into account the hatred towards the current government in r/Mexico and other subs. 

* The past 3 presidents were ultra conservative right wing puppets from the U.S. In 2012, with help of the ATF, local government armed a specific cartel with U.S. MILITARY GRADE weapons and equipment, and it happened to be a cartel that was rival of the one that was fond of Felipe Calder√≥n, the then president. The response of Calder√≥n was to use our army to ""hunt"" the opposing cartels in the streets and the only thing that achieved while trying to protect his interests, was to unleash a bloodbath that is still echoing to this day and that took the life of thousands of civilians. 

* The current president stopped Calderon‚Äôs and Pe√±a Nieto‚Äôs usage of the arme and is going to force them act under a set of orders and plans that before, were completely secret and obviously absent since the army was more like another Cartel group which had absolute power to start a shooting in the middle of a market just because ""someone"" gave them the instruction to do so. A lot of people are using this to twist the reality and claiming that the president is militarizing the country which is incredibly idiotic and completely false. 

* So in short, for right winged Mexicans: Having the army act freely, make shootings anywhere, and having news of soldiers actually being undercover sicarios = good. Having the army follow rules = AMLO wants Mexico to be like Venezuela. 

* Mexico‚Äôs external relations have ALWAYS been of neutrality. Mexico‚Äôs UN embassy and the President explicitly condemned Putin, but they said they weren‚Äôt going to join Biden‚Äôs sanctions, which let me remind you, have achieved **ABSOLUTELY NOTHING** but backfiring on the U.S. and Europe‚Äôs civilians. 

* When the invasion happened and Mexico decided not to join in with the sanctions, the opposing party from the current president, the ultra conservative PAN, tried to make a ""Mexico‚Äôs Russian Appreciation Agency"" or something like that, in an idiotic attempt of making it seem like it was an official government thing. Of course, it made it to Reddit and some people ate it straight. It seems like Mr. Zeleneskyy is desperately looking to get the attention of the U.S. now trying to throw their neighbors under the bus."

&gt; With 100% of the vote now counted, the Social Democrats have received the largest percentage of votes at 30.3%. The Sweden Democrats are the second-strongest party, gaining 20.5% of the vote in their best-ever election performance.

&gt; Paralleling other right-populist movements, the party sought to portray itself as &amp;quot;Advocating for &amp;#039;ordinary people&amp;#039; against a corrupt elite at the height of a global recession,&amp;quot; wrote scholar Danielle Lee Tomson in a paper on the rise of the Sweden Democrats.

&gt; Increasingly visible criminal violence and gang activity are also playing a role in the rise of the Sweden Democrats.

"&gt;Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week, a gathering that is unlikely to yield any progress towards ending the conflict.  
  
Climate change, Iran sanctions, and worsening global poverty will also feature at the annual meeting of world leaders in New York this week."
"So I assume that huge chunks of the Ukraine economy are non-viable at this point right?

Like no one is paying their mortgage, car loans, or credit cards right? No one is continuing to pay a mortgage on a destroyed house right? Or at least in portions of the country this is true right?"
Our federal government might consider something similar

I can see this playing out throughout Europe, even where it's still in early stages. Cycle shift.
Frequent traveller to China, long before covid or even China was even an economic power, in mean 1992, Chinese generally think that foreigners (Western, to them) bring diseases to their country.

I could imagine Europeans voting for more immigration controls, but I could also imagine immigrants (who are mostly conservative themselves) voting for right wing parties also. The left wing might tolerate them more, but it's possible that being for lgbt rights, women's rights, right to express uncomfortable opinions, secularism, etc might just be too much for some immigrants.

The CCP will never - ever - be able to take Taiwan back with force.  Compare this with DDay in WWII.  The coast of France is 50 miles across the English Channel from the UK.  Taiwan is more than twice as far from Mainland China.  In DDay the Allie‚Äôs had the element of surprise.  With China, we will know from satellites the minute they begin to amass any force at all. In DDay the Luftwaffe - Germanys Air Force - was nonexistent after the fight w Russia.  With Taiwan, they have a substantive and modern Air Force and air defense system.  In DDay, the Allie‚Äôs were invading a willing territory of France under resistance that could provide support.  The Taiwanese have been preparing to defend the island for 70 years.  In DDay the attacking forces were already battle tested, both from experience in WWI and WWII. The Chinese have not been in a war, especially where they had to attack someone ‚Äî ever.  The Chinese have no blue water Navy to consolidate their attack on Taiwan ‚Äî they have 2 used air craft carriers from Russia.  The US alone has 15 super carriers capable of operating anywhere in the world.  The list goes on.  The Chinese would need more than 2 million troops to land on Taiwan, take it and keep it.  DDay, as big as it was, sent 156,000.
"Too late, too little, too limited, but could be a great start.

They should also generate source of funding for societally constructive(!) means from other societally harmful industries, not just these energy-related ones.

Moreover, 
* taxes are just one way, other ways that could complement or replace such include profit-caps (anything exceeding limits goes to the public) (the same applies for capping energy prices)
* the profits of renewable energy companies should be allowed to be far higher or, in this case, should be taxed far less than societally harmful industries"

The xenophobia in Xi's China is absolutely scary and staggering. It's to prep and brainwash the populace for war against the west.
Consider this. Invade Russia, then trade it for the territories they invaded on Ukraine.
And of course she didn‚Äôt have health care, so she couldn‚Äôt afford to get them replaced.
Current analysts are basing [invasion scenarios](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2022/08/12/in-think-tanks-taiwan-war-game-us-beats-china-at-high-cost/) on technological advances of the US and China in 2026 so the timeline lines up.

"&gt;Sherman's March to the Sea (also known as the Savannah campaign or simply Sherman's March) was a military campaign of the American Civil War conducted through Georgia from November 15 until December 21, 1864, by William Tecumseh Sherman, major general of the Union Army.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The campaign began with Sherman's troops leaving the captured city of Atlanta on November 15 and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;His forces followed a ""scorched earth"" policy, destroying military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property and persons, disrupting the Confederacy's economy and transportation networks.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The operation debilitated the Confederacy and helped lead to its eventual surrender.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sherman's decision to operate deep within enemy territory without supply lines was unusual for its time, and the campaign is taught by some historians as an early example of modern warfare or total war.

"Everybody around Ukraine is calling for Ukraine to get weapons.

The nonsense here is mind boggling.  As if Trump had not been directly elected by Russian propaganda campaigns.  All the chanting of build the wall and now you are booty hurt that Mexico is for support of peace negotiations.
Its s way to put pressure on the EU. Erdogan loves these double games. Win-win for him, maybe not the best for Turkey, but since when is a wannabe dictator interested in what is best for his country?
